This project aims at applying AI models and techniques in addressing real life problems. In this particular situation, this project is about training an efficient, accurate model in detecting road sign issues. This will include:
  - Locating the traffic sign from a picture
  - Classify the sign as “not damaged” or damaged with different status including “bent”, “broken sheet”, “graffiti”, “rust”, “crack”. 

Summary of outcomes
  - Our final model will take a picture as input, and return a picture with a bounding box around the traffic sign, the status of the sign (not damaged/ bent/ broken/ graffiti/ rust/ crack) with accuracy of up to 71%.
